# Chesspedia

Chesspedia is basically a table on contents type of application. Using puppeteer, the application crawls the wiki chess page for all the subheading links. All links in one convenience spot

React, Node, Express, Puppeteer

1. You can see all the sublinks here.

2. And once you want to read more about a specific one, you click on it and it takes you directly to the wiki chess page.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

<h3>`npm start on /client` and `node server.js on /puppeteer`</h3>

<h3>Summary</h3>
Created a server with node and express that crawls the chess wikipedia page and displays the information on the client side using React. I like working with puppeteer and learned a lot how to use it. I wanted to create something that crawls the web and after tinkering around this application was born. I was also inspired by the recently Netflix hit 'The Queen's Gambit'.
