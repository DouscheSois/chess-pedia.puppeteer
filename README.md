# Chesspedia

React, Node, Express, Puppeteer

<p>Created a server with node and express that crawls the chess wikipedia page and displays the information on the client side using React. I like working with puppeteer and learned a lot how to use it. I wanted to create something that crawls the web and after tinkering around this application was born. I was also inspired by the recently Netflix hit 'The Queen's Gambit'.</p>
